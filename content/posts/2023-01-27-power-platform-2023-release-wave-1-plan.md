The Microsoft Power Platform 2023 release wave 1 plan was recently announced with a **TON** of interesting updates!

The release plan contains hundreds of new features across Power Platform so here is a brief summary of some of my highlights:

## Power BI

### Integrate Power BI into Teams meetings

Power BI is adding new in-meeting experiences for Microsoft Teams. Users can add content like reports to Teams meetings by adding the Power BI tab to their meetings.

## Power Apps

### Drag and drop to build responsive pages more easily

The new layout configuration allows makers to add and easily reorder controls within responsive layout containers. Makers can resize controls and adjust the spacing between them right in the authoring canvas.

## Power Automate

### Define sequential approvals in Power Automate

With this feature, makers can define multiple levels/stages in an approval flow in Microsoft Teams or Power Automate and assign who needs to approve them.

## Power Virtual Agents

### Use Power Fx expressions in authoring canvas

Expression authoring is a key capability for any bot in order to implement more sophisticated logic. For example, you can now author expressions to perform data validation or control looping logic.

## Microsoft Dataverse

### Implement calculated column capabilities inside formula columns

The goal of this feature is to address calculated columns capabilities that aren't currently supported inside the formula columns to eventually replace the classic calculated columns feature.

## AI Builder

### Classify documents with custom AI models

You can custom train an AI model to classify documents. For example, documents with different types of invoices might arrive to a single file share or shared mailbox. With this capability, users can create flows that appropriately route these documents.

## Other updates

There are also updates for the following areas:

- Governance and administration
- Pro development
- ISV experiences
- Data integration
