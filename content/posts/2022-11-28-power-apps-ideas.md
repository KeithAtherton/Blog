Picture this: You have a Power App gallery which contains employee name text data using Power Fx formula ```ThisItem.Name```:

![Power Apps gallery containing employee names](/img/2022-11-28-power-apps-ideas/gallery.png "Power Apps gallery containing employee names")

Next, you want to change the text format from "Peter Gibbons" to, say, "Gibbons, Peter".

However, you're not (yet) a Power Fx guru. What can you do???

Well, a feature which I've found useful is **Power Apps Ideas** which allows you to transform examples to Power Fx formulas by using the power of AI models.

In this article, I will show you how to how to use Power Apps Ideas. This is how it works:

1. In your gallery, select a text control:

![Power Apps gallery with an employee name selected](/img/2022-11-28-power-apps-ideas/gallery-name-selected.png "Power Apps gallery with an employee name selected")

2. Go to the properties pane Ideas tab:

3. Change the text to the format you want. In this case, I'll change the text from "Peter Gibbons" to "Gibbons, Peter":

4. Click the "Get ideas" button to generate the Power Fx formula:

5. Click the "Apply" button to apply the Power Fx formula to the text control:

6. Check the gallery to ensure the effect is what you expect!

Here are some examples generated by Power Apps Ideas:

|Power Fx Formula|Example|
|-|-|
|```ThisItem.Name```|Peter Gibbons|
|```Last(Split(ThisItem.Name, " ")).Result & ", " & First(Split(ThisItem.Name, " ")).Result```|Gibbons, Peter|
|```Left(ThisItem.Name, 1) & ". " & Last(Split(ThisItem.Name, " ")).Result```|P. Gibbons|
|```First(Split(ThisItem.Name, " ")).Result```|Peter|
|```Last(Split(ThisItem.Name, " ")).Result```|Gibbons|

Also, if you select a control and get the following message, click the "Learn more" link for more info.
