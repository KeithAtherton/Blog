## The book

This is my review of the book *Architecture Modernization: Socio-technical alignment of software, strategy, and structure* by Nick Tune with Jean-Georges Perrin.

The official book description is as follows:

> Concrete tools, techniques, and processes to align software architecture with your business domains, organizational design, team topologies, and corporate strategy.

I selected this book as I'm always looking to improve my solution architecture skills, and this book's description sounded like a holistic approach to software design covering the software, strategy, and structure of architecture.

The book's suggested audience is as follows:

> Anyone who makes decisions about software architecture or organization design, including architects, CTOs, principal engineers, and tech leads.

## My review

The book covers various practices such as Domain-Driven Design (DDD), EventStorming, Team Topologies, and Wardley Mapping, as well as concepts such as Conway's Law.

Personally, this was incredibly useful as I hadn't used all of these practices before so it was great to learn about them and can now keep them "up my sleeve" in case they are required in future.

Another benefit was, for the techniques that I *had* used before, the book described the practices in detail which helped resolve any gaps in my knowledge of them.

There are clear explanations on how carefully designed modern architecture has the potential to provide a powerful competitive advantage, with several real-world examples.

Importantly, the book is firm in its position that architecture is more than technologies and patterns, and that we must view architecture more holistically by understanding the
factors that enable a modern organization to be high-performing and how architecture contributes.

A nice touch was sharing a link to a Miro board for the book which lists the techniques covered and is an excellent resource.

I would highly recommend this book if you're looking to improve your architecture skills.
