## My 2023

Wow, it feels like only yesterday when I was writing my review of 2022 - how time flies!

On balance, my 2023 was a great year. As with last year, a highlight has been connecting with many fantastic people, and some have become good friends.

If we haven't met yet, feel free to [connect with me](https://linktr.ee/keithatherton).

## Work

Earlier this month, I started a new role as **Power Platform Solution Architect for ANS**, which involves working closely with with business stakeholders to understand requirements and deliver solutions.

I LOVE solving problems and helping others so this role is an ideal fit for me. I'm looking forward to working with the talented people there to make a positive difference to others.

## Microsoft MVP Award
 
A major highlight for this year was the honour of receiving the [Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) award](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/MVP/profile/e2e93563-95fb-ed11-8f6d-000d3a560942) for the Business Applications category in recognition of my “exceptional technical community leadership”!

Microsoft state:

> MVPs are technology experts who passionately share their knowledge with the community.

If anyone wants to learn more about the Microsoft MVP award then [reach out](https://linktr.ee/keithatherton), I'd be happy to help!

## Other Award Nominations

Surprisingly for me, I kindly received the following nominations for the **Microsoft Community UK Recognition Awards**:

- Best User Group award for the *Scottish Power Platform User Group*, along with Charlie Phipps & Stuart Baxter
- Community Rising Star award
- The Communities, Community Hero award

While I didn't win any of the awards, I was humbled and grateful to receive votes.

## Public Speaking

## Events

Attending user groups, conferences and other events in-person and virtually is a great opportunity to meet awesome people and occasionally present at. Some highlights for this year:

Attending the second [Microsoft Power Platform Conference](https://powerplatformconf.com/#!/) in Las Vegas, Nevada in October. I was also lucky enough to contribute the following at the conference:

- Spoke at the Sharing is Caring session
- Presented AMA (ask me anything) at the Microsoft MVP Showcase Theater
- Volunteered at the Super Users table

I also had the privilege of volunteering for [DATA:Scotland](https://www.datascotland.org/) again, hosted at the impressive Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh!

I was grateful to, again, co-organise the amazing [Festive Tech Calendar](https://festivetechcalendar.com/) which turned out to be another successful online event.

## Blogging and Social Media

I've continued to post to my [blog](https://www.keithatherton.com/). The cadence has varied throughout the year, to be honest, but I'm planning on getting back into a consistent routine in the new year.

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MrKeithAtherton) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-atherton) are social media channels which I'm still active on.

Back in May, I started [#100DaysOfSelfCare](https://www.keithatherton.com/posts/2023-06-02-100daysofselfcare/) during *Mental Health Awareness Week* and was joined by Azure McFarlane in posting about self-care every day for 100 days.

My [monthly newsletter](https://eepurl.com/ieZGc1) is going well, with many more subscribers joining this year. My favourite section is the **Community Spotlight** where I highlight the fantastic work that others are doing in the community!

## Learning

I passed the following [certifications](https://www.credly.com/users/keith-atherton):

- Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fundamentals (ERP)
- Microsoft 365 Fundamentals
- Microsoft Power Platform Developer Associate
- Microsoft Power Platform Solution Architect Expert
- Microsoft Power Platform App Maker Associate

Studying for certifications is a great way to learn new things and ensure that I fully understand a subject so it's something I'll continue with in 2024.

## Scottish Power Platform User Group

The [Scottish Power Platform User Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/98501235) started this year and I was lucky enough to attend their first in-person event in Edinburgh in February, speak at their virtual event in March, then join the organising team in June!

Co-founders Charlie Phipps and Stuart Baxter have welcomed me to the team and, throughout this year, we've organised several in-person and virtual events, and taken turns to host the events as well as speak at them.

## On Air in the Cloud Podcast

Earlier this year, Gregor Suttie, Matt Boyd and I created the [On Air in the Cloud podcast](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/onairinthecloud).

It's a fortnightly podcast containing interviews with people working with technology in interesting ways. We've interviewed some impressive people on there, it's been a lot of fun - [check it out](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/onairinthecloud)!

## LinkedIn Learning Instructor

Last year, I became a [LinkedIn Learning Instructor](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/keith-atherton) and released my first course, [Azure Data Fundamentals (DP-900) Cert Prep: 3 Working with Non-Relational Data on Azure](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/azure-data-fundamentals-dp-900-cert-prep-3-working-with-non-relational-data-on-azure).

This year, I created a new course with LinkedIn Learning's Jeff Kellum & Adam Slomiak, [Cert Prep: Power Platform Developer Associate (PL-400)](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/cert-prep-power-platform-developer-associate-pl-400), which aligns with my passion for the Power Platform.

I'm very proud of the course that we put together and hope you will [take and enjoy it](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/cert-prep-power-platform-developer-associate-pl-400)!

## Power Platform Community

Throughout the year, I've spoken on the **Microsoft Power Platform community call** hosted by David Warner & Hugo Bernier, delivering the following sessions:

- [With Great Power (Apps) Comes Great Reusability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vET3pNSyUA8)
- [How to Prepare for Microsoft Power Platform Certifications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWj6Ujj9C1Q)
- [The MPPC23 Chronicles: Conference Recap and Highlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otnRg5AeO0A)
- [24 Days of Festive Learning with Power Apps and Copilot with Nathalie Leenders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79eu6eWCPT0&t=357s)

I also contributed the [Glassmorphism Sandbox Power Platform sample](https://github.com/pnp/powerplatform-samples/tree/main/samples/glassmorphism-sandbox) which illustrates how to use glassmorphism, combining a blur effect with transparency, using a HTML text control.

For those contributions, I received the following badges:

- [Community Call Presenter](https://www.credly.com/badges/dae9c6d0-d72e-4ea2-811e-f9a9ecdd6390)
- [Sharing is Caring Contributor](https://www.credly.com/badges/ec6b64fa-03e4-47a4-a5de-697aae209ba4)

- [Community Contributor](https://www.credly.com/badges/f3fcf369-3158-40d6-9983-4a49e38cc29c)

## Power Platform Community Forums

I've continued to help answer Power App questions on the [Power Apps Community forums](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/541757).

Again, solving problems and helping others is what I love to do so helping others (and learning from others) on the forums is something that resonates with me.

I was grateful to be awarded **Super User 2023 Season 1** and **Super User 2023 Season 2** for my work on the forums this year!

## Mentoring

I've continued mentoring some amazing people, each of them with different motivations, such as the following:

- Learning how to get involved with the tech community
- Learning how to grow and develop their tech community contributions further
- Learning about the Microsoft MVP award
- Learning how to develop their career in IT consultancy

It's a privilege to mentor these wonderful people as they're coming from a positive place of wanting to develop themselves.

I'm always amazed by how much I learn from them, too. They get something, I get something - these relationships truly are a win-win!

## Other Experiences

As well as work and tech community activities, I also enjoyed many other experiences such as:

- Visited family and friends
- Travelled in Scotland, England, Ireland, and USA
- Went to several concerts and events such as seeing the U2 at the Sphere, Las Vegas
- Visited a submarine museum!

## So, enough about the good stuff...

OK, we've heard about the success stories. There's plenty I still need to work on, including the following:

- Healthy work/life balance*
- Be more creative: painting, drawing, baking, build Lego, etc
- Post to this blog more regularly
- Create more videos for my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MrKeithAtherton)

*Working towards a healthy work/life balance is something I'm going to address in an upcoming online VRT (virtual round table) event for ShortList Recruitment, called *Setting Your New Year's Tech Community Resolutions*. [Register for the event here](https://www.linkedin.com/events/settingyournewyear-stechcommuni7132754074176745472/about/).

## Looking Ahead

As with the end of last year, I'm staying positive and looking forward to what the new year brings.

I hope that you have a happy and successful 2024!
