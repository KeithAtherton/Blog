The official book desciption is as follows:
Concrete tools, techniques, and processes to align software architecture with your business domains, organizational design, team topologies, and corporate strategy.
I selected this book as I&amp;rsquo;m always looking to improve my solution architecture skills, and this book&amp;rsquo;s description sounded like a holistic approach to software design covering the software, strategy, and structure of architecture.</description></item></channel></rss>
