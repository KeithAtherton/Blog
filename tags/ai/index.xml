This feature is made possible by use of next-generation AI technology and means you can write a sentence such as:
Build an app to manage music playlists for my favourite artists such as Metallica
(Well, that&amp;rsquo;s one example but the choice is yours ðŸ˜„)</description></item><item><title>Power Apps Ideas</title><link>https://www.keithatherton.com/posts/2022-11-28-power-apps-ideas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.keithatherton.com/posts/2022-11-28-power-apps-ideas/</guid><description>Picture this: You have a Power App gallery which contains employee name text data using Power Fx formula ThisItem.Name:
Next, you want to change the text format from &amp;ldquo;Peter Gibbons&amp;rdquo; to, say, &amp;ldquo;Gibbons, Peter&amp;rdquo;.
