OK, let&amp;rsquo;s set the scene: It&amp;rsquo;s a sunny Thursday afternoon in May in central Scotland. The hero is working on a Power App, and binds the following collection (colItems) to a gallery control:
ClearCollect(colItems, { ID:1, Name:&amp;#34;Dog&amp;#34; }, { ID:2, Name:&amp;#34;Cat&amp;#34; }, { ID:3, Name:&amp;#34;Rabbit&amp;#34; } ); Great, the gallery is showing the data collection as expected!</description></item><item><title>Power App Mobile QR Code</title><link>https://www.keithatherton.com/posts/2023-04-28-power-app-mobile-qr-code/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.keithatherton.com/posts/2023-04-28-power-app-mobile-qr-code/</guid><description>Super quick way to open a Power App on your mobile device: scan the Power App&amp;rsquo;s mobile QR code in the app&amp;rsquo;s Details section!

It&amp;rsquo;s a great place to find help as well as offer help to others. In fact, when searching on Google (other search engines are available) for answers to Power App questions, I&amp;rsquo;m often directed to the Microsoft Power Apps Community where, often, someone has encountered a similar issue and helpful folks have responded with a solution.</description></item><item><title>Power Platform 2023 Release Wave 1 Plan</title><link>https://www.keithatherton.com/posts/2023-01-27-power-platform-2023-release-wave-1-plan/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.keithatherton.com/posts/2023-01-27-power-platform-2023-release-wave-1-plan/</guid><description>The Microsoft Power Platform 2023 release wave 1 plan was recently announced with a TON of interesting updates!

Next, you want to change the text format from &amp;ldquo;Peter Gibbons&amp;rdquo; to, say, &amp;ldquo;Gibbons, Peter&amp;rdquo;.
However, you&amp;rsquo;re not (yet) a Power Fx guru. What can you do???
Well, a feature which I&amp;rsquo;ve found useful is Power Apps Ideas which allows you to transform examples to Power Fx formulas by using the power of AI models.</description></item></channel></rss>
