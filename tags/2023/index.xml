My 2023 Wow, it feels like only yesterday when I was writing my review of 2022 - how time flies!
On balance, my 2023 was a great year. As with last year, a highlight has been connecting with many fantastic people, and some have become good friends.
If we haven&amp;rsquo;t met yet, feel free to connect with me.</description></item></channel></rss>
