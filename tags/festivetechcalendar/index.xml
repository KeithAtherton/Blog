I was privileged to be one of the co-organisers along with Gregor Suttie, Richard Hooper, Simon Lee, and Lisa Hoving. It was great to work with the organising team, speakers, our chosen charity, supporters, and everyone else, to be able to deliver a wonderful event.
There was a huge number of sessions submitted, and all event sessions are still available for catch-up here:</description></item></channel></rss>
