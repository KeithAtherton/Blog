Hey! Welcome to my first blog post :)

I'm Keith Atherton and I've been a professional software developer for over 20 years. I'm Microsoft certified, a public speaker, a LinkedIn Learning instructor, and a mentor.

In this blog, I'm planning to write about all things development, including .NET, C#, SQL, Microsoft Azure, Power Platform, and non-technical subjects.
