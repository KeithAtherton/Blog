## What is ChatGPT?

&NewLine;

ChatGPT is a chatbot that uses the GPT-3 language model to generate responses to user input in a conversational manner.

GPT-3 (short for "Generative Pretrained Transformer 3") is a state-of-the-art language processing model developed by OpenAI, capable of generating human-like text.

But wait. Everything you read above was generated by ChatGPT itself!

ChatGPT's capabilities, as listed on the intro page, are:

- Remembers what user said earlier in the conversation
- Allows user to provide follow-up corrections
- Trained to decline inappropriate requests

&NewLine;

And ChatGPT's limitations, also listed on the intro page, are:

- May occasionally generate incorrect information
- May occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content
- Limited knowledge of world and events after 2021

&NewLine;

This means there are **lots** of requests you can submit, and it's very interesting seeing ChatGPT's responses!

To try it out yourself, follow the instructions in the next section.
