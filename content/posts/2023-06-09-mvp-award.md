## My Microsoft MVP Award

I'm honoured to have received the **Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) award** for Business Applications in recognition of my *"exceptional technical community leadership"*!

Microsoft state:

> MVPs are technology experts who passionately share their knowledge with the community.

Huge thank you to everyone who has supported me and helped with opportunities along the way - and that includes **YOU** for being an awesome supporter who reads my blog! 🙏

Congratulations to all the other newly-announced MVPs, there are some absolute rockstars there who have become good friends too 👏
