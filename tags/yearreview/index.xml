My 2023 Wow, it feels like only yesterday when I was writing my review of 2022 - how time flies!
On balance, my 2023 was a great year. As with last year, a highlight has been connecting with many fantastic people, and some have become good friends.
If we haven&amp;rsquo;t met yet, feel free to connect with me.</description></item><item><title>My Review of 2022</title><link>https://www.keithatherton.com/posts/2022-12-31-my-review-of-2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.keithatherton.com/posts/2022-12-31-my-review-of-2022/</guid><description>[Photo: Sunrise over the Atlantic Ocean on my flight home to Scotland from Florida back in September.]
My 2022 My 2022 was a year of highs, lows, and lots of new experiences.
However, my highlight of the year has been the many amazing people I&amp;rsquo;ve connected with throughout my personal life, work, tech community and elsewhere. Some people I&amp;rsquo;ve known for years, others I&amp;rsquo;ve met for the first time this year.</description></item></channel></rss>
