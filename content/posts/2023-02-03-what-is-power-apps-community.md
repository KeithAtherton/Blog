The **Microsoft Power Apps Community** is a place where you can connect with peers, share ideas, and learn from experts for everything Power App-related.

It's a great place to find help as well as offer help to others. In fact, when searching on Google (other search engines are available) for answers to Power App questions, I'm often directed to the Microsoft Power Apps Community where, often, someone has encountered a similar issue and helpful folks have responded with a solution.

The site contains various forums (such as *News & Announcements*, *Building Power Apps* and *Microsoft Dataverse*), knowledge bases (such as *Community Accounts & Registration*), and the Power Apps Community Blog.

For several months, I've been a regular visitor to the Microsoft Power Apps Community and help people with their Power Apps questions, mostly for the *Building Power Apps* forum, as that's one of my core skills.

My [profile](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/541757) has risen through the ranks of *Regular Visitor*, *Helper I*, *Advocate I*, *Resolver I*, *Resolver II*, *Helper V*, *Resolver III*, and I'm now scaling the dizzy heights of (fanfare, please ðŸŽº) **Responsive Resident**!

When you engage with the community, you can earn badges. So far, I've earned several badges such as:

- 10th Solution
- 25th Kudo Received
- 100th Reply
- 50 Kudos Given
