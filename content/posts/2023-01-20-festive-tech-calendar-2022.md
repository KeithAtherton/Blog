The **Festive Tech Calendar 2022** online event ran throughout December, 2022 and was fantastic!

I was privileged to be one of the co-organisers along with Gregor Suttie, Richard Hooper, Simon Lee, and Lisa Hoving. It was great to work with the organising team, speakers, our chosen charity, supporters, and everyone else, to be able to deliver a wonderful event.

There was a huge number of sessions submitted, and all event sessions are still available for catch-up here:

In fact, I also submitted a session myself!:

We decided to raise money for a wonderful charity called [Missing People](https://www.missingpeople.org.uk/) who are the only UK charity lifeline for anyone affected by someone going missing. We're very grateful for everyone's generosity in raising **Â£2,518** (at time of writing)!

Talking of generosity, we had some amazing supporters offering awesome prize giveaways: 5BytesPodcast provided an Elgato Stream Deck, and Avanade provided a festive Lego set.
