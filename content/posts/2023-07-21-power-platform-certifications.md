Note: All information and screenshots are correct at time of writing but may be different in future as Microsoft certifications are subject to change (and often do!).

## Which Power Platform-related certifications are available?

You'll see several certifications with exams prefixed with PL- which cover various Power Platform services such as Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power BI.

However, note that you'll also see certifications with exams containing different prefixes such as MB- and DP- as some certifications overlap with other non-Power Platform services such as Dynamics 365 and Azure Data Platform.

## Which Power Platform-specific certifications are available?

Some of us cherry-pick the certifications we want, whereas others like to collect them all! ðŸ˜„
