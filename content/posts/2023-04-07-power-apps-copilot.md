## Copilot in Microsoft Power Apps

OK, I hope you're sitting down. An announcement was made recently which blew my mind: Copilot in Microsoft Power Apps (preview)!

This feature is made possible by use of next-generation AI technology and means you can write a sentence such as:

> Build an app to manage music playlists for my favourite artists such as Metallica

(Well, that's one example but the choice is yours ðŸ˜„)

And copilot builds it for you!

- The app: done
- Data tables: done
- Sample data: done
- Back-end logic: done
- Need to tweak something like adding an extra column: done
- Need suggestions on how to improve the app: done

Wow!

But that's not all. As well as Copilot in Power Apps helping application makers, it **also helps end users**. Copilot-powered experiences can be placed in-app so users can discover insights in conversation instead of clicks, by asking questions such as:

> Which album by The Winery Dogs have I played the most?

(Again, your choice may be different... ðŸ˜„)

It has also been announced that native integration of AI-empowered Power Virtual Agents into Power Apps is now possible. This means that developers can now quickly and easily add a next-generation AI-powered Power Virtual Agents bot to their apps.

## Summary

I can think of several projects which would have taken days using a pro-code approach, only hours using low-code, but just *minutes* using copilot in Power Apps.

This feels like a game-changer which has the power to change app development in a big way, definitely something to keep an eye on.
