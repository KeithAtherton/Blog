## What is #100DaysOfSelfCare?

During Mental Health Awareness Week in May 2023, the wonderful [Azure McFarlane](https://twitter.com/amac_ncheese) and I started a movement on Twitter with the hashtag **#100DaysOfSelfCare**.

Here is the first tweet: https://twitter.com/MrKeithAtherton/status/1658537794732523521

## What is self-care?

Self-care is anything you do to take care of yourself so you can stay physically, mentally, and emotionally well.

It can be as simple as going for a gentle walk or having lunch away from your desk, to learning something new or trying a new experience.

## How can I get involved?

We'd love to hear about what *you* do for self-care!
